Section IX: Spatial & Intertemporal Distribution of Road Accidents 
 
1. Urban Vis - a- Vis Rural 
An analysis of road accidents in urban and rural areas for the calendar year 2016 reveals that 
rural areas are more prone to road accidents. The total number of road accidents in urban areas 
were lower (2,16,813) as compared to number of accidents in rural areas (2,63,839).The 
percentage share of accidents in rural areas and urban areas were54.9 and 45.1 respectively in 
total number of accidents in the country. A comparison of percentage share of  fatal accidents, 
total accidents, persons killed and injured in rural vis-Ã -vis urban is illustrated in Table 9.1. 
The table indicates that significant investment & improvement in rural roads is required for 
reducing accidents in rural areas. Detailed State/UT-wise information on the spatial distribution 
of road accidents rural as well as urban is given in Annexures  XXXVI and XXXVII. A 
comparative picture of road accidents, persons killed and injured in urban and rural areas is 
illustrated in Chart 9.1

The House referred the Bill to Standing Committee. Based on the recommendation of 
the Standing Committee, the Bill was revised and introduced in Lok Sabha in April 
2017. Lok Sabha has passed the Bill. The Bill is pending in the Rajya Sabha. 
 
(xvii) Motor Vehicle (Amendment) Bill, 2016 also envisage the creation of National Road Safety 
and Traffic Management Board (NRSTMB).   
   
2. 
National Road Safety Policy  
 
Based on the globally accepted multi-pronged strategy and the safe-system approach for 
improving road safety, the National Road Safety Policy outlines the initiatives to be taken 
by the Government at all levels. The policy is outlined as under: -  
 
I. Preamble  
  
The Government of India is deeply concerned about the growth in the number of road 
accidents, injuries and fatalities in recent years. It recognizes that road accidents have now 
become a major public health issue, and the victims are mainly the poor and vulnerable road 
users.  
  
2.  The Government of India further recognizes that as road accidents involve roads, motor 
vehicles as also the human beings, road safety needs to be addressed on a holistic basis. It 
also recognizes that regardless of jurisdictions, the Central and State Governments have a 
joint responsibility in reducing the incidence of road accidents, injuries and fatalities.  
  
3.  In the light of this, the Government of India, through this National Road Safety Policy, 
states its commitment to bring about a significant reduction in mortality and morbidity 
resulting from road accidents.   
 
II. Policy Statements 
In order to achieve a significant improvement in road safety, the Government of India is 
committed to:  
  
(i) Raise Awareness about Road Safety Issues  
The Government would increase its efforts to promote awareness about the various aspects 
of road safety, the social and economic implications of road accidents and what needs to be 
done to curb the rising menace of road accidents. This would enable and empower the 
different stakeholders to play a meaningful role in promoting road safety.  
 

 
43 
 
(ii) Establish a Road Safety Information Database  
  
The Government will provide assistance to local bodies, Union Territories and States to 
improve the quality of crash investigation and of data collection, transmission and analysis. 
A National Road Safety Information System will be established for providing continuity 
and policy guidelines to this activity.  
 
(iii) Ensure Safer Road Infrastructure  
  
 
The Government will take measures to review standards pertaining to safety in the design 
of rural and urban roads and bring them in consonance with international best practices 
keeping in view Indian traffic conditions. Continuing application of Intelligent Transport 
Systems (ITS) under a national framework to establish a safe and efficient transport system 
will be encouraged.  
  
(iv) Safer Vehicles  
  
The Government will take steps to ensure that safety features are built in at the stage of 
design, manufacture, usage, operation and maintenance of both motorized and non-

(xi) Strengthening Enabling Legal, Institutional and Financial Environment for Road 
Safety  
The Government will take appropriate measures to ensure that the required legal, 
institutional and financial environment for road safety is further strengthened and a 
mechanism for effective coordination of various stakeholders is put in place. The reforms 
in these areas would provide for the active and extensive participation of the community at 
large, of the private sector, academia and NGOs.  
  
III.  Implementation Strategy  
The Government has decided to establish a dedicated agency viz. a National Road Safety 
and Traffic Management Board (NRSTMB) to oversee the issues related to road safety and 
evolve effective strategies for implementation of the Road Safety Policy.  
 
CONSTITUTION OF NATIONAL ROAD SAFETY COUNCIL (NRSC)/ STATE 
ROAD SAFETY COUNCILS AND DISTRICT COMMITTEES  
 
NRSC is the apex body for road safety established under Section 215 of Motor Vehicles 
Act 1988. It is chaired by Honâble Minister for Road Transport and Highways and 
Ministers-in-charge of Road Transport of States / UTs, DG Police of all States and 
representatives from the Ministries/Departments such as Home Affairs, Human Resource 
Development, Railways, Industry, Petroleum & Natural Gas, Environment & Forests, 
Health & Family Welfare etc. are official members.  
 
Under section 215 of Motor Vehicle Act 1988, a State Govt. by notification in official  
gazette can constitute a State Road Safety Council comprising a Chairman and such other 
members as the government considers necessary and on such terms and conditions that 
govt. determine. Similarly, there is also a provision for District Road Safety Committee 
for each district.  
 
The Ministry has requested all States/UTs for setting up of State Road  Safety Council and 
District Road Safety Committees. Around all the States have constituted the State Road 
Safety Council. 
 
 

 
45 
 
IV. ONGOING SCHEMES OF MINISTRY OF ROAD TRANSPORT & HIGHWAYS TO IMPROVE ROAD 
SAFETY 
 
(i)  Setting up of Inspection & Certification (I&C) Centres: 
    An increasing number of vehicles in developing countries like India are not in a 
roadworthy state. Poor maintenance and servicing of old in use vehicles not only damages 
the environment but also poses great safety hazard on road. The compliance with limits or 
standards of vehicles exhaust emissions for air quality improvement purpose is directly 
dependent on the implementation and / or enforcement of effective vehicle inspection 
system. Due to the rapid increase in public means of transportation, the improvement of 
vehicle performance capability and servicing becomes an ever increasing urgency. An 
effective air pollution control and thus, a decrease of vehicles emissions, improvement of 
roadworthiness can be achieved by the implementations of an effective vehicle inspection 
system. 
The Ministry of Road Transport & Highways therefore implementing a scheme for setting 
up of at least one model Inspection & Certification Centre in each State/UT with Central 
assistance to check the fitness of in-use vehicle. The State may further replicate the 
scheme. During 11th Plan, MoRTH sanctioned 9  Centre for setting up one each in the 
State of Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Gujarat, Maharashtra, Rajasthan, Haryana, Madhya 
Pradesh, U.P and Delhi. The I&C Centre of Maharashtra and Haryana are operational. The 
I&C Centre of Delhi, Madhya Pradesh, Karnataka and Gujarat will be operational shortly. 
The remaining three centres will be operational by the end of 2017.   
 
 
     During 12th five year plan, the Ministry has also sanction 10 more such centers 
in the States of West Bengal, Chhatisgarh, Odisha, Punjab, Sikkim, J&K, Pondicherry, 
Mizoram, Nagaland and Kerala on a pilot basis.  Some of these are already at  various 
stages of implementation. 
 
(ii) Institutes of Driving & Research (IDTR)  
 Large numbers of road accidents are taking place on Indian roads every year resulting in 
the death of around one lakh forty six thousand persons. The causative analysis of various 
road accidents studies carried out in the past infers that majority of road accidents occur 
due to driversâ fault. The report of year 2015 indicates that 77.1% of all road accidents are 
due to the fault of the driver. Despite having adequate provisions in Central Motor Vehicle 
Rules (CMVR) which directly as well as indirectly helps in ensuring good driving skills 
and knowledge of rules of road regulation among drivers, it was felt that there is an urgent 
need to impart driving training, both theoretical and practical to the existing and aspiring 
drivers. Need has also been felt for setting standards and monitoring driving training and 
issue of Driving Licence based on an objective scientific process of testing skills. For this 
purpose, the Ministry formulated a scheme to set up model Institutes of Driving Training 
and Research (IDTR) in States/UTs 
 
During the 10th Five Year Plan, 13 Model Driver Training Schools was sanctioned and all 
are complete and functional. During 11th Plan, the Ministry of Road Transport & 
Highways accorded sanction for setting up 8 IDTRs i.e. one each in the States of Himachal 
Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Maharashtra, Haryana, Bihar, Tripura and Uttar 
Pradesh. The IDTRs of Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Maharashtra are functional.  The 
civil construction of rest of the IDTR is in progress and likely to be completed shortly.  
 
 

 
46 
 
During 12th Five Year Plan, the Ministry has   sanctioned 6 more IDTR   one each in the 
State of Chhattisgarh, Telangana, Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra Manipur and Sikkim. One 
Regional Driving Training Centre (RTDC) centres have also been sanctioned West Bengal. 
In principle approval has been accorded to set three in RDTC in Maharashtra.  
(iii) National Highway Accident Relief Service Scheme (NHARSS) 
The scheme entails providing cranes and ambulances to States/ UTs/NGOs for relief and 
rescue measures in the aftermath of accidents by way of evacuating road accident victims 
to nearest medical aid centre and for clearing the accident site.  So far, 347 ten ton cranes 
and 106 small/medium size cranes have been provided under the scheme.  509 ambulances 
have been provided to States/UTs/NGOs under the scheme.  
 
Further, Ministry of Road Transport & Highways has also provided 140 advanced life 
support ambulances to 140 identified hospitals upgraded under the Ministry of Health and 
Family Welfareâs Scheme âestablishment of an integrated network of Trauma Centersâ 
along the Golden Quadrilateral, North-South and East-West Corridors of the National 
Highways by upgrading the trauma care facilities in 140 identified State Government 
hospitals.  
 
(iv)   Publicity Measures and Awareness Campaign on Road Safety: 
With a view to spread road safety awareness among the general public, the Government 
has been undertaking various publicity measures in the form of telecasting/broadcasting of 
T.V. spots/Radio jingles, display of cinema slides, hoardings, organizing Road Safety 
Week, seminars, exhibitions,  all India essay competition on road safety, printing of 
handbills/stickers, posters, etc., containing road safety messages for various segments of 
road users viz. Pedestrians, cyclists, school children, heavy vehicle drivers, etc. , painting 
on road railings on themes of road safety, road safety games, calendars depicting road 
safety messages, etc.  The Publicity campaign is carried out through DAVP, Doordarshan, 
All India Radio and newspapers.  It is the ministryâs effort to make road safety a social 
movement.

V. Improving the Road Accident Database:  
With a aim  to capture the circumstances under which an accident occurs and to move 
closer towards an accurate, consistent and objective road accident database, the Ministry 
of Road Transport & Highways had constituted a Committee in November, 2016 including 
experts from IIT-Delhi, IIT-Kharagpur, senior officers from Police and Transport 
Departments of States [ADG Police (Traffic), Government of Tamil Nadu and Transport 
Commissioner, Government of Tripura], Ministry of Health & Family Welfare, WHO and 
officers of the Ministry to review and recommend the road accident formats to be filled 
by the State/UT Police Departments to the Ministry for the Annual publication of âRoad 
Accidents in Indiaâ.  
The Committee had recommended a uniform accident Recording Format to be adopted by 
the Police in all the States/UTs and a set of the corresponding annual road accident data 
Reporting Format (17 Forms) in which State/UT Departments would furnish data to the 
Ministry.  With the acceptance of recommendations of the committee by the ministry, all    
the States/U.Ts have been requested to adopt the revised Road accident Recording Formats 
and to furnish the annual road accident data in the new Recording Formats w.e.f calendar 
year 2017.  The approved formats have been uploaded in the Ministryâs website ( 
www.morth.nic.in)   Five Zonal Workshops each at IIT Bombay, IIT-Kharagpur, IIT-
Kanpur, IIT-Madras, IIT-Guwahati,  covering all States/U.Ts  have also been  conducted to 
familiarize the police officers/personnel with the new formats so that the information could 
be filled accurately and with ease.

Section XII: Road Accidents Mitigation Measures taken by MoRTH 
in recent past 
 
It is clear from the Report that road accidents are multi-causal which requires multi-
pronged measures to mitigate the problem through concerted efforts of all agencies concerned, 
both in the Central Government and State Governments. These measures can be broadly divided 
into road and vehicles engineering; education and awareness for drivers and the general public; 
enforcement of road safety laws and trauma care facilities. 
 
Road accidents mitigation measures which are within the purview of the Ministry of 
Road Transport & Highways include road engineering design for safety, proper road marking 
and signages; safety standards for vehicles like use of seat-belts, helmets etc., education and 
awareness campaigns and programmes. The various accidents mitigation measures taken up by 
the Ministry in recent past are as follows: 
 
A. Road engineering measures 
 
i) 
Identification and rectification of accident black spots: So far, 789 accident black 
spots have been identified in consultation with the States/UTs, of which 651 spots 
are on the National Highways and 138 are on State Roads or with other agencies. In 
case of the black spots on National Highways, a total of 140 spots have been rectified; 
80 spots awarded for rectification works; 40 spots are at bidding stage; 163 spots are 
being taken care as part of the ongoing development projects; and the balance are at 
different stages of survey investigations. The Ministry ensures that immediate 
cautionary and speed reduction measures are installed at the black spots till they are 
rectified through long term measures. 
 
ii) 
Road Safety Audits: Road Safety Audits at different stages have been made part and 
parcel of all road development projects on EPC and BOT modes. Stand-alone Road 
Safety Audits have been sanctioned on National Highways in a length of about 400 
km in 2016-17 and in a further length of 980 km in 2017-18 till August, 2017. 
 
iii) 
Installation of crash barriers: Installation of crash barriers in accident prone areas 
in hilly States have been sanctioned in a length of 143 km at a cost of Rs. 88 crore in 
2016-17. Crash barriers in a further length of 137 km at a cost of Rs 85 crore have 
been sanctioned in 2017-18 till August 2017. These are at different stages of bidding. 
 
iv) 
Road Safety Annual Plans: A separate Road Safety Annual Plan has been framed 
for improvement of road safety at selected locations on the National Highways. A 
total of 11 (nos.) road safety improvement works at a cost of Rs 255 crore have been 
sanctioned in 2016-17 which are in different stages of execution. Road Safety Annual 
Plan for 2017-18 has also been approved and the proposals are in different stages of 
investigations. 
 
v) 
Safety furniture in road projects: Provision of essential road safety furniture like 
road signs/markings, delineators etc., has been specified for all road development 
projects including re-surfacing works and riding quality improvement works. 
 
vi) 
Assistance for Road Safety Engineering works on State roads: Central Road Fund 
(CRF) Rules have been amended in June 2016 earmarking 10% of the CRF funds for 
Road Safety Engineering works on State Roads. Detailed guidelines have been issued 

 
49 
 
and all the States and UTs have been requested to take up road safety improvement 
works on State Roads as per these guidelines at selected locations. 
 
vii) 
Training and capacity building: Training courses and training workshops have 
been organized for building capacity in road safety audits and road safety 
engineering. A Certificate Course for Road Safety Auditors is being conducted by 
Indian Academy of Highway Engineers (IAHE) which is a training institute under 
Ministry of Road Transport & Highways. First batch of 20 Auditors have already 
been certified and second batch is in progress. Two National level workshops and 
several regional training workshops in different States have been organized in which 
more than 1000 engineers have been given training in road safety engineering and 
road safety audits. 
 
B. Vehicular safety standards and IT enabled safety measure 
 
i) 
Vehicular Safety Standards: Trucks are prohibited from carrying protruding rods; 
Anti-locking Brake System (ABS) made mandatory on Heavy Vehicles; Cars to have 
provision for fitment of at-least one child seat. Car Crash Standards to be made 
mandatory w.e.f., 1st April, 2018; ABS/CBS for Two Wheelers mandated w.e.f. 
1st April, 2018; AHO (Automatic Headlight On) made mandatory for Two 
Wheelers to make them more conspicuous; Bus Body Code for safer and comfortable 
buses; Truck Body Code for safe cabins to drivers and other road users; Mandatory 
Fitment of Speed Governors on Transport Vehicles to avoid over speeding. 
 
ii) 
Buses with IT enabled safety measures under NIRBHAYA SCHEME: The 
Ministry has issued notification that all public service vehicles, (except two and three 
wheelers, e-rickshaws) have to be equipped with or fitted with vehicle location 
tracking device and one or more emergency buttons. The vehicle location tracking 
device and emergency button shall be fitted by the manufacturer or their dealer or the 
respective operator. 
 
C. Education and Awareness 
 
i) 
Model Institutes of Drivers Training and Research (IDTR): The Ministry is 
implementing a scheme for setting up of Model Institutes of Drivers Training and 
Research (IDTR) by States/UTs. So far 24 (nos.) ITDRs have been sanctioned in 
different States/UTs and about 16 are complete and functioning. 
 
ii) 
Awareness and Publicity: The Ministry observes Road Safety Week every year with 
the objective of spreading awareness about road safety. The 28th Road Safety Week 
was observed from 9th to 15th January 2017 during which mass awareness 
programmes such as Road Safety Walk, essay competition for children, radio talk 
shows, street plays were organised. A mobile app â e-Challan was launched by the 
Ministry to support the enforcement of traffic rules and transport laws by the State 
Police and Transport Departments. 
 
D. Post-crash response and trauma care 
 
i) 
Good Samaritans Guidelines: Guidelines have been issued by the Ministry to 
prevent the harassment of âGood Samaritansâ who help road accident victims. The 

 
50 
 
Honâble Supreme Court has accepted these guidelines and has asked the States for 
implementation. 
 
ii) 
Effective Trauma Care: The National Highways Authority (NHAI) provides 
ambulances at a distance of 50-60 km on its completed stretches of National 
Highways. Cranes and ambulances are provided to various State Governments under 
the National Highway Accident Relief Service Scheme for development on National 
Highways. 
 
Enforcement of traffic rules and motor vehicles rules are extremely important 
components of road safety and accidents mitigation measure which are under the purview of 
State Police and Transport Departments. The data has unambiguously demonstrated the 
prevalence of unlawful behaviour on the roads such as drunken driving, over speeding, red light 
jumping, overloading, lack of lane discipline etc., thereby causing accidents, injuries and 
fatalities. The Motor Vehicles (Amendment) Bill, 2017 has made provisions for stricter penalties 
for various traffic rules violations with the objective of strengthening enforcement and ensuring 
greater compliance.
